"    your PIN is required, a PIN matrix, with dots instead of the numbers, "

"                    <p>A passphrase can be any word, a set of letters or "
"even a sentence. You could also consider the\n"
"    passphrase to be the 25th word of the seed, as with the passphrase an "
"entirely wallet will be generated.</p><p>Your passphrase should be "
"memorable, though.\n"
"    Typically, you would not write it down anywhere, to eliminate any "
"possibility of it being discovered. Remember that\n"
"    you are entering the passphrase directly into the computer, and this "
"process is not protected against keyloggers\n"
"    like the PIN entry. For this reason, you should not be tempted to "
"disable your PIN even if you use the passphrase feature!</p><p>If\n"
"    you enable the passphrase protection, you will be asked for a passphrase "
"every time you connect your TREZOR and work\n"
"    with a bitcoin (altcoin) wallet such as TREZOR Wallet or Electrum.</"
"p><p>The passphrase has a triple\n"
"    security effect.</p><p>1. It makes your TREZOR impervious to physical "
"attack. Even if your TREZOR was\n"
"    stolen and the chip examined under an electron microscope to discover "
"your recovery seed, your bitcoins will still\n"
"    be safe!</p><p>2. It protects your bitcoins in case someone steals your "
"Recovery seed from you. Without\n"
"    your passphrase, the thief won't be able to access your coins.</p><p>3. "
"A passphrase or more passphrases\n"
"    can be used with the same TREZOR device to create the so-called \"hidden "
"wallets,\" giving you a great\n"
"    advantage in situations such as being held at a gunpoint, (also known as "
